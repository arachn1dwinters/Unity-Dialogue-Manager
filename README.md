# Unity Dialogue Manager
By Orchid Winters

This is a piece of code that I've spent the last month or so coding on or off, just to learn how to make a custom editor in Unity.
Saving and loading DOES NOT WORK, nor is there a way to call it from your existing game. This is meant for other people to build off of.

# Use
Download all of the files and put them into an folder called "Editor". A menu option called "Custom Tools" should appear.

Enjoy!
